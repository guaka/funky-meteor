[Funky Meteor](http://funky.meteor.com/) is a very basic modular synth
using HTML5 audio.

April 2013 it only really works well in Chrome, on desktops.
[Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html) also supports audio in.

Looking forward to build mobile apps based on this code.
